# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is a ghost runner game where you need jump from one door to another and increase you score. This was created in Javascript in P5.js by me getting taught from WhitehatJR. This is also a class work of the Capstone Class of Class 19 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. To edit the game change the code in the sketch.js file.
